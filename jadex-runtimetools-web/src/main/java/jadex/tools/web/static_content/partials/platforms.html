		required 3rd party jars are already included within the respective
		distributions. Step-by-step

		usually be fine for use in development purposes, but should not be

	<h2>License and Versions</h2>
	<p>
		The open source software (OSS) files are released under
		<a href="#project/license">GPL-License</a>. Access to the Pro version and
		commercial (e.g. redistribution) licensing can be requested from
		<a href="http://www.actoron.com/">Actoron GmbH</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The features currently described at <a href="#project/features">Jadex
		Features</a> are available in both the OSS and the Pro version. We will try
		keeping most <strong>functional features</strong> publicly available. The
		Pro version mainly adds <strong>non-functional features</strong> that we
		consider relevant for production environments. These features include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Management Extensions (e.g. controlling Jadex platforms remotely from a shell, service pools with automatic load-balancing)</li>
		<li>Security Features (e.g. SSL message transport)</li>
		<li>Deployment Support (e.g. automatic load balancing)</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Which Distribution to Choose?</h2>
	<p>
		Several different packages are available for download. The
		<strong>standard</strong> and <strong>pro</strong> packages
		include all jars and sources of the main system and the standalone
		platform. For size reasons, several addons as well as web application
		deployment files have been excluded from the base package and can be
		downloaded separately. The addons provide extra features such as
		3D visualization and web services support. For a quick-start of using Jadex
		in a Maven build environment, an example project is provided that can be
		used for retrieving the required Jadex jars via Maven.
