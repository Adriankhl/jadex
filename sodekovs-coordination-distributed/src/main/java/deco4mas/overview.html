<u>De</u>centralized <u>Co</u>ordination for <u>M</u>ulti-<u>A</u>gent <u>S</u>ystems (DECO4MAS)<br>
<br>
This framework aims at simplifying the task of developing self-organizing dynamics within MAS.<br>
<br>
Self-organizing phenomena can be traced back to the presence of feedback loops within agent 
populations! DECO4MAS provides a programming model that understands agent as vehicles for autonomous 
behaviors which are steered via a generic feedback model. The programming model is non-intrusive, 
i.e. developers construct agents according to architecture specific development methodologies and 
conceive/design/adjust/ the feedback structures that steer the global system dynamics in parallel.<br>
<br>
Autonomous and intelligent software agents are annotated with coordination information and the (optional) 
utilization of "decentralized coordination mechanisms" can be tailored due to xml-based configurations.
