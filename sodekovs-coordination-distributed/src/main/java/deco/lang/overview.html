MASDynamics modeling language.<br>
<br>
The MASDynamics modeling language provides a systemic modeling
level that supports designing decentralized agent coordination.
System Dynamics (SD) approaches the analysis of
dynamic system behaviors by modeling the macroscopic,
causal structure of systems. State variables variables describe
quantitative system properties and interdependencies
characterize how changes of variables influence each other.<br>
<br>
This modeling approach supports two description levels.
First, application-independent strategy definitions consist
of node and link definitions without references to agent
models and their internal elements. Secondly, these models
can be mapped to agent implementations by detailing the
variable declarations with references to agent models and
agent-intern events. In addition, the interaction techniques
that are used to realize interdependencies can be parameterized.<br>
<br>
The language meta model, a graphical notation and semantics are discussed in:

Agent Coordination, Kommunikation in Verteilten Systemen, 2009, 79-90.
