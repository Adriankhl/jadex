# This file uses LR to represent a newline; Windows uses instead CR+LF
# So better you NEVER use Editor to edit this file; use WordPad instead, which
# is capable of handling plain text files with LR as newline
##### #####
# Every line beginning with a # is a comment is is ignored
# Every line should represent a single IP+Port combination;
# alternatively a hostname can be given instead of a fixed IP
# Example are:
#     192.168.1.34:3645
#     134.100.3.24:2357
#
# TODO what is with trailing zeros? e.g. 134.100.003.024:3465
#134.100.11.94:1337 well 1337 would be much more to use, but 4711 is nice, too
134.100.11.94:4711
