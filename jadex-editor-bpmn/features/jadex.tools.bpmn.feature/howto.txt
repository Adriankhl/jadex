build dist.zip with 'mvn package'

zip does not work as is :-(
- put site.xml in zip (add feature with corresponding version)
- in zip: build jar files for the feature and plugin (omit base dir)

todo:
- automatically generate site.xml
- build jars instead of directories for plugin and feature
- place generated files (.zip, build.xml, ...) in target
