		The test center offers the possibility to implement agent-based unit tests similar to
		object-oriented unit tests (cf. the test framework <a href="http://www.junit.org/index.htm" target="_top">JUnit</a>). 
		In contrast to object-oriented tests in the Jadex framework the tested unit is not an object
		but an agent. As agents can exhibit arbitrary complex reactive and proactive behaviour its
		testing is far more difficult than it is in the object-oriented case. One reason for these
		difficulties is that it is hard to set-up a defined start state which is always used to perform
		the tests as agents can actively modify that state. Hence, the Jadex unit test framework
		concentrates on the validation of inner-agent functionalities such as black-box testing
		of functionalities from capabilities and other agents. Similar to the object-oriented testing also in Jadex
		specific test agents (similar to test classes) can be implemented. Each test agent can perform
		an arbitrary number of single test cases.

		The graphical testcenter tool offers an easy to use interface that allows 
		to run a bundle of testcases (called a test suite) and shows a green bar if all the 
		testcases could be performed successfully and a red one otherwise, together with 
		debug information.
	</p><div class="figure"><a name="tools.testcenter.fig_overview"></a><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/testcenter/testcenter_overview.png" alt="Test center overview"></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;8.1.&nbsp;Test center overview</b></p></div><p>
		The testcenter is subdivided into four panels (cf. <a href="tools.testcenter.html#tools.testcenter.fig_overview" title="Figure&nbsp;8.1.&nbsp;Test center overview">Figure&nbsp;8.1, &#8220;Test center overview&#8221;</a>).
		The model tree on the left shows the agents of the project and highlights those that have been
		recognized as testable (that use the test capability). The "Test suite settings" panel contains
		a list of all test agents that belong to the current test suite. Below that panel the "Test suite
		execution" panel provides means for initiating resp. aborting the test suite execution and 
		offers overview information about the current state of the execution. At the bottom the "Details"
		panel provides in-depth information about the results of the single tests.

			The model tree shows all agents of your current project and allows for adding/removing 
			test agents to the test suite. The tree automatically searches for
			testable agents and marks them visually 
			<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/testcenter/new_agent_testable.png"></span>. 
			Each source folder that contains at least one testable agent changes its icon 
			to red and green
			
			<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/testcenter/new_src_folder_testable.png"></span> 
			
			and the packages that contain tests change the red and green icon to 
			
			<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/testcenter/new_package_testable.png"></span>.			
				
			
				
			For adding resp. removing testable agents to/from the test suite different options are available:
			<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
						Adding a single test case can be done by double-clicking the testable agent. 
					</p></li><li><p>
						Activating the popup menu on a single test case agent allows for adding 
						<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/testcenter/new_add_agent_testable.png"></span>
						or removing 
						<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/testcenter/new_remove_agent_testable.png"></span>
						the selected test case.
					</p></li><li><p>
						Activating the popup menu on a test case folder allows for adding 
						<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/testcenter/new_add_package_testable.png"></span>
						or removing 
						<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/testcenter/new_remove_package_testable.png"></span>
						recursively all contained test cases. 
					</p></li><li><p>
						After having selected an agent or a folder adding 
						<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/testcenter/new_add_package_testable.png"></span>
						or removing 
						<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/testcenter/new_remove_package_testable.png"></span>
						these items can also be done by using the corresponding buttons from the tool bar.
					</p></li></ul></div>
			
			In the following screenshot the popup for a folder in the model tree is shown: 
			
			<div class="figure"><a name="tools.testcenter.fig_modeltree"></a><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/testcenter/testcenter_tree_rightclick.png" alt="Right-Click in Model Tree"></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;8.2.&nbsp;Right-Click in Model Tree</b></p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tools.testcenter.settings"></a>8.1.2.&nbsp;Settings Panel</h3></div></div></div><p>
				The test suite settings panel offers information about the current test suite.
				
				</p><div class="figure"><a name="tools.testcenter.fig_settings"></a><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/testcenter/testcenter_settings.png" alt="The test suite settings panel"></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;8.3.&nbsp;The test suite settings panel</b></p></div><p>
				
				All the testable agents of the test suite appear in the list. With the x-symbol you can remove testcases, with 
				the "+"-symbol you can add new test suites and enter their name manually.			
			</p><p>
				The checkbox below the list allows to turn on or off checking for duplicates. If duplicates are
				forbidden the addition of testcases that are already contained in the list will have no effect.
				Otherwise you can add the same testcase more than once.
			</p><p>
				The testcase timeout option allows for specifying the maximum amout of time that a single test agent is
				permitted to be executed. If the test agent does not return the test results within this timeframe
				it will be considered as failed. The default timeout for testcases is 20000 ms and can be adapted
				if necessary, i.e. if one of test agents needs a longer test execution time. 
			</p><p>
				The testcase cuncurreny setting can be used to determine how many test agents should be executed
				at the same time. By setting the concurrency to 1 a sequential execution can be enforced. In general,
				the concurrent execution has several consequences. One important pragmatic aspect is that the
				execution will be much faster as the center can always execute some test and needs not to wait for
				the result of one specific test. On the contrary the parallel execution of tests also may lead to
				non-deterministic test results, if timeouts are used and the system load becomes too high.
				On the right hand side four buttons are offered. One for adding a testcase from the file system, 
				two for loading and saving the test suite and one for clearing the current test suite.

				The test suite execution panel shows the test execution progress bar. This progress bar is green
				as long as all tests have been successfully executed. The first failed test causes the
				progress bar changing its color from green to red. Furthermore the progress bar contains
				overview information about the number of already executed tasks (performed: x/total), the
				time the exexcution took so far and the number of failed tests (failed: y/total).
			</p><p>
				The panel also offers three buttons, to run the test suite execution, save 
				the test report and to clear the results of a previous test suite execution.
				The run button can be used to start the execution and changes to an abort button
				during execution. Pressing abort immediately stops the current execution.
				The save button can be used to store the detailed test result permanently in
				a file. The output file is saved in HTML and can hence be loaded by any browser.
				The clear button can be utilized to delete the contents of the details panel
				and additionally resets the progress bar.

				The details panel shows the detailed results of the testcase execution, 
				including a detailed report about success and failure of the testcases
				(cf. <a href="tools.testcenter.html#tools.testcenter.fig_details" title="Figure&nbsp;8.5.&nbsp;The details panel">Figure&nbsp;8.5, &#8220;The details panel&#8221;</a>).
			</p><p>
				The report begins with a test execution summary which lists all the test
				agents and shows the execution state. Tests that are currently in execution
				are marked as "?", whereas already failed tests are visualized with "X"
				and succeeded tests with "O".
				In addition the overview shows the execution time that was needed for
				each of the test agents.
			</p><p>
				Below the execution overview the detailed results are depicted.
				For each test agent a list of all the performed test cases is shown.
				Each test case report consists of the name, description and a result.
				In case of a testcase failure additionally a failure reason is displayed.
