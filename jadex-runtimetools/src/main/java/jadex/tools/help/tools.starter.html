		The Starter is a central administration tool for managing Jadex agents.
		It offers basic functionalities for starting and stopping agents as well
		as more advanced ones such as integrity checking
		of agent and capability models. In <a href="tools.starter.html#tools.starter_pic" title="Figure&nbsp;3.1.&nbsp;Starter perspective">Figure&nbsp;3.1, &#8220;Starter perspective&#8221;</a>
		a screenshot of the Starter tool is depicted. The tool mainly consists
		of three different panels. On the upper left hand side the
		<span class="emphasis"><em>Model Tree</em></span> is located. Below the Model Tree the
		<span class="emphasis"><em>Running Agents</em></span> of the platform are shown. On the
		right hand side the <span class="emphasis"><em>Model Panel</em></span> shows details of
		the currently selected agent or capability model.

 		The model tree allows for easy navigation of Jadex agent and capability
		models. Each direct child of the root-node represent a <span class="emphasis"><em>classpath</em></span>
 		entry of the current project. Initially the model tree is empty.
 		<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
				 	<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/starter/new_addfolder.png"></span>
					can be used to add a new directory or jar file to the model tree
					and to the classpath from which models are loaded.
				 </p></li><li><p>
				 	<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/starter/new_removefolder.png"></span>
					can be used to remove a directory or jar file from the model tree
					and the classpath.
				 </p></li></ul></div>

 		Within the tree packages, agents and capability files are displayed according to
		the icons explained below:
		<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
				 	<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/starter/new_package.png"></span>
					represents a Java/Jadex package. All agents and capabilities
					should be placed in the same package hierarchy as their
					corresponding Java plans and other Java classes.
				 </p></li><li><p>
				 	<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/starter/new_agent.png"></span>
					represents a Jadex agent model file. By selecting the file in
					the tree the model will be loaded and displayed in the Model
					Panel.
				 </p></li><li><p>
				 	<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/starter/new_capability_small.png"></span>
					represents a Jadex capability model file. By selecting the file in
					the tree the model will be loaded and displayed in the Model
					Panel.
				 </p></li></ul></div><p><b>View refresh.&nbsp;</b>
			In addition to the standard start and stop functionalities the model tree also
			supports more advanced features. If not explicitly turned off in the "Model"
			menu the tree is automatically refreshed in certain time intervals. This means that
			changes on hard-disk are immediately reflected within the model tree. You can also
			initiate a refreshment directly by clicking the
			<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/starter/new_refresh_small.png"></span>
			button.
		</p><p><b>Integrity checking.&nbsp;</b>
			In addition all models found in the tree are automatically checked for integrity if
			this feature isn't turned off in the "Model" menu. This feature allows
			to effortlessly locate corrupt agent and capability files in the project. If
			a corrupt file is found, the file as well as all packages up to the root are marked
			as corrupt. A corrupt entity is displayed with a red bolt
			<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/starter/new_broken.png"></span>.
