			The debugger panel allows watching the internal
			processing inside an agent. The window is made up of the agenda area,
			the agenda control area in the middle and the details view at bottom (see
			<a href="introspector.debugger_panel.html#introspector.fig_debugger_panel" title="Figure&nbsp;6.4.&nbsp;The Debugger Panel of Introspector">Figure&nbsp;6.4, &#8220;The Debugger Panel of Introspector&#8221;</a>.

			The agenda contains all current action entries of the agent,
			whereby entries in light-grey denote already processed actions.
			In addition it can be seen whether entries currently have
			a valid precondition and thus can subsequently be executed;
			otherwise they are marked as (invalid). Such invalid actions will not be executed,
			but just ignored by the execution mechanism.
			To see some more information about an agenda action you can
			double-click on it and inspect its values in the details view.
			In addition to observing the agent's internal behavior the tool also allows you
			to control the agenda execution by performing actions in step mode.
			If the execution mode is set to
			"step" or "cycle" you can use the
			"forward" button to execute as many steps as shown in the
			"execute &lt;n&gt; agenda actions" choice.
			The difference between step and cycle mode concerns only the execution
			of ProcessEventActions that are decomposed to finer-grained sub steps
			(FindApplicableCandidatesAction, SelectCandidatesAction and
			ScheduleCandidatesAction) when the
			"step" mode is activated.
			Therefore, the step mode allows you to examine the details of
			the BDI plan selection process what can be helpful in
			understanding and explaining unexpected application behavior.
			The "open steps" status bar shows the progress of the action execution
			by highlighting the number of steps the agent still has to perform
			whereas in the the "processing state" line it can be seen
			if a step is currently requested or has been finished.
