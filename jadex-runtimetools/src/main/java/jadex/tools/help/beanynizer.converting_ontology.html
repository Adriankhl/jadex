            the Beanynizer. To convert an existing ontology perform the following steps (note, this process has
			only been tested with Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 2.1 and might not work with 3.0):
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Load the old ontology and save it under a new name (to keep the original
                        file untouched).</p></li><li><p>Use the <span class="guimenu">Project</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Merge included projects</span> option to remove references to other external
                    ontologies.</p></li><li><p>Include the Beanynizer default ontology as described above. If your
                        original ontology was also designed for use with
                        a FIPA-compliant agent platform, ignore any errors, e.g., complaining about
                        duplicate definition of classes like <code class="classname">AgentAction</code>,
                        etc.</p></li><li><p>If your original ontology did contain FIPA classes with different names (e.g., <code class="classname">AID</code> for agent identifiers)
                        change all references to these classes (if any) to now refer to the Beanynizer classes (e.g., <code class="classname">agent-identifier</code>).
						Afterwards remove the original FIPA classes.</p></li><li><p>When your original ontology was not designed to be used with FIPA,
                        you might have to rearrange the class hierarchy, such that all your classes
						are derived from the appropriate classes (such as AgentAction).</p></li><li><p>Now the awkward part: Make sure that all your classes and slots are
                        instances of the Beanynizer metaclasses. The required metaclass is called
                            <code class="literal">BEANYNIZER-CLASS</code> and is a subclass of the
                            <code class="literal">:STANDARD-CLASS</code>. You change the metaclass by selecting
                        each single class and using the <span class="guimenuitem">Change
                        metaclass...</span> option from the popup menu, but a much faster way
                        is to change to the instance tab, and use drag and drop. The same procedure
                        should be done for your slots, which should be instances of the
                            <code class="literal">BEANYNIZER-SLOT</code>. Finally, you should make the
                        Beanynizer class and the Beanynizer slot the default metaclasses by using
                        the <span class="guimenuitem">Set as default class/slot meta class</span> option
                        from the popup menu.</p></li><li><p>You're done! You can now start to generate code, or to adjust code
                        generation options as described above.</p></li></ul></div></div></body></html>
