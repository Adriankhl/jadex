		The DF browser can be used to display the current service registrations 
		of application agents. The left part of the browser view 
		(see <a href="tools.dfbrowser.html#tools.dfbrowser.fig_overview" title="Figure&nbsp;4.1.&nbsp;DF browser overview">Figure&nbsp;4.1, &#8220;DF browser overview&#8221;</a>)
		shows the locally available DF agent of the platform. (Currently it
		is not possible to include remote DF agents into the view). If the
		DF agent is selected the currently registered agent descriptions and
		services will be displayed in the center view. This view can be refreshed
		by invoking the "refresh" popup menu directly on the DF agent.
		In addition a regular refresh interval can be specified via the "Refresh"
		menu, which offers the alternatives to perform a refresh "never", or
		every "1", "5" or "30" seconds.

			The center view is split-up into three different panels. The uppermost
			"Registered Agent Description" panel shows all agent descriptions of the
			selected DF agent, i.e. if no DF agent is selected no registrations will
			be visible. For each registered agent description, the agent name, the
			lease time, the contained services as well as a overview about the used
			ontologies, languages and protocols are shown.
		</p><p>
			Below the agent description panel the "Registered Services" panel shows
			agent services in more detail. For each service its name, type, ownership
			as well as a short info about ontologies, languages and protocols is displayed.
			Additionally an entry
			exists for the containing agent description making clear to which of the agent
			descriptions a service belongs. Per default the service descriptions of all
			agent descriptions are presented. Selecting an agent description in the
			"Registered Agent Description" panel restricts the services presented in the
			lower panel to those that belong to one of the selected agent descriptions.
		</p><p>
			In the lowermost panel one service is shown with all its properties, i.e.
			especially all contained ontologies, languages, protocols and properties
			can be inspected. The selection of the service description that should be
			made visible in the "Service Properties" panel has to be done in the
			"Registered Services" panel (here only a single selection is allowed).
		</p><p>
		 	<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/dfbrowser/new_killagent.png"></span>
			Besides viewing the registered agent descriptions and services the DF
			browser can also be used for deleting obsolete agent descriptions. This
			can be done by selecting the service (or services) in the agent description
			panel and activating the remove operation via the popup menu or via
			the corresponding button in the toolbar.
