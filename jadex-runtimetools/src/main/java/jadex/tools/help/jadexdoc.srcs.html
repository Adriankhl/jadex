			 The Jadexdoc tool will generate output originating from four different types of
			 "source" files: Agent and Capability source files, package comment
			 files, overview comment files, and miscellaneous unprocessed files.
		</p><p><b>Processing of source files.&nbsp;</b>
				The Jadexdoc tool processes files that end with ".agent.xml" and ".capability.xml"
				plus other files described below. If you run the Jadexdoc tool by explicitly
				passing in individual source filenames, you can determine exactly which ADF
				files are processed. However, that is not how most developers want to work, as
				it is simpler to pass in package names.
			</p><p><b>Package Comment Files.&nbsp;</b>
				Each package can have its own documentation comment, contained in its own
				"source" file, that the Jadexdoc tool will merge into the package
				summary page that it generates. You typically include in this comment any
				documentation that applies to the entire package.
			</p><p>
			To create a package comment file, you must name it
			<code class="filename">package.html</code> and place it
			in the package directory in the source tree along with the agent description
			files. The Jadexdoc tool will automatically look for this filename in this
			location. Notice that the filename is identical for all packages.
		</p><p>
			The content of the package comment file is one big documentation comment, written
 			in HTML, like all other comments. When writing the comment,
			you should make the first sentence a summary about the package, and not put a title
			or any other text between <code class="computeroutput">&lt;body&gt;</code> and the
 			first sentence.
		</p><p>
			When the Jadexdoc tool runs, it will automatically look for this file; if found,
			the Jadexdoc tool does the following:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Copies all content between
						<code class="computeroutput">&lt;body&gt;</code> and
						<code class="computeroutput">&lt;/body&gt;</code> tags for
						processing.
					</p></li><li><p>
						Inserts the processed text at the bottom of the package summary page it
						generates, as shown in Package Summary.
					</p></li><li><p>
						Copies the first sentence of the package comment to the top of the package
						summary page. It also adds the package name and this first sentence to the list of
						packages on the overview page.
					</p></li></ul></div><p>
		</p><p><b>Overview Comment File.&nbsp;</b>
				Each application or set of packages that you are documenting can have its own
				overview documentation comment, kept in its own "source" file, that
				the Jadexdoc tool will merge into the overview page that it generates. You
				typically include in this comment any documentation that applies to the entire
				application or set of packages.
			</p><p>
			To create an overview comment file, you can name the file anything you want,
			typically <code class="filename">overview.html</code> and place it anywhere, typically at the top
 			level of the source tree. The content of the overview comment file is one big documentation comment,
			written in HTML, like the package comment file described previously.
			When you run the Jadexdoc tool, you specify the overview comment file name with
			the <code class="option">-overview</code> option. The file is then processed similar to that of a package
			comment file.

			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Copies all content between <code class="computeroutput">&lt;body&gt;</code> and
						<code class="computeroutput">&lt;/body&gt;</code> tags for processing.
					</p></li><li><p>Inserts the processed text at the bottom of the overview page it generates.</p></li><li><p>
 						Copies the first sentence of the overview comment to the top of the
						overview summary page.
					</p></li></ul></div><p>
		</p><p><b>Miscellaneous Unprocessed Files.&nbsp;</b>
				You can also include in your source any miscellaneous files that you want the
				Jadexdoc tool to copy to the destination directory. These typically includes
				graphic files, example agent description files, and self-standing HTML files
				whose content would overwhelm the documentation comment of a normal agent
				description file.
			</p><p>
			To include unprocessed files, put them in a directory called <code class="filename">doc-files</code> which
			can be a subdirectory of any package directory that contains source files. You can
			have one such subdirectory for each package. For example, if you want to include
			the image of a creature <code class="filename">Creature.png</code> in the
			<code class="filename">jadex.examples.hunterprey.creature.CleverPrey</code> agent documentation, you place
			that file in the <code class="filename">jadex/examples/hunterprey/creature/doc-files/</code> directory.
			Notice the <code class="filename">doc-files</code> directory should not be located at
			<code class="filename">jadex/examples/doc-files/</code> because <code class="filename">examples</code> does not
			directly contain any source files.
		</p><p>
			All links to these unprocessed files must be hard-coded, because the Jadexdoc
			tool does not look at the files, it simply copies the directory and all its
			contents to the destination. For example, the link in the
			<code class="filename">CleverPrey.agent.xml</code>
			doc comment might look like:
			</p><p>
				</p><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;!-- The image of the CleverPrey agent: &lt;img src="doc-files/Creature.png"&gt; --&gt;</pre><p>
			</p><p>
