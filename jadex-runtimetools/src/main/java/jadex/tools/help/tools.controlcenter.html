		The Jadex Control Center (JCC) represents the main access point for all available
		Jadex runtime tools. The JCC itself provides its functionalities via plugins and is
		therefore quite easily extensible. Currently the following plugins are shipped with
		the standard distribution of Jadex: Starter, DF Browser, Conversation Center, Introspector,
		Tracer, Test Center and Jadexdoc. Each tool provides its own perspective in the JCC and is 
		described in subsequent chapters.

		Main aspect of the JCC is the project handling. A project is used to store user
		settings made in the JCC itself (like window sizes or user settings) and the settings
		from the various plugins. Project files consist of a main project file (ending ".jpr"
		for Jadex project) and additional property files for each plugin.
		In addition, the JCC uses a startup configuration, taken from the configuration under
		the key <code class="filename">jcc.plugins</code> which is will be taken from the path specified
		in the startup argument (-conf in Standalone resp. -Dconf= when using JADE). 
		If the platform has been started without the conf option Jadex will search first
		in the current start directory for <code class="filename">jadex.properties</code> and if there are no properties
		available the properties will be loaded from the jar file (e.g. from
		<code class="filename">jadex_standalone.jar</code> in case of the standalone platform).
		In addition to the plugin list the configuration also contains a
		pointer to the last project the user worked with (<code class="filename">jcc.project</code>). 
		At the launch time of JCC the last project will be automatically reopened.

			The Control Center is realized as Jadex agent
			<code class="filename">jadex/tools/jcc/JCC.agent.xml</code> and is started per default
			when the Standalone platform is launched. To prevent the Control Center being
			started the <code class="option">-nogui</code> option can be used for the Standalone
			platform. Using other adapters the Control Center can be launched by simply starting
			the corresponding JCC agent mentioned above.

			The Jadex Control Center provides different graphical areas that are partly
			customized by some of the plugins. Basically the JCC offers:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
						a <span class="emphasis"><em>menu bar</em></span> for invoking basica actions. Concretely,
						the "File" menu provides options for loading/saving the current project
						settings. In addition, the currently opened project name is displayed in the JCC
						window's title bar (see <a href="tools.controlcenter.html#tools.controlcenter.fig_overview" title="Figure&nbsp;2.1.&nbsp;JCC window">Figure&nbsp;2.1, &#8220;JCC window&#8221;</a>).
						The "File-&gt;Settings" menu item allows to open the platform settings dialog
						described in <a href="tools.controlcenter.settings.html" title="2.2.&nbsp;Platform Settings">Section&nbsp;2.2, &#8220;Platform Settings&#8221;</a>.
						The "File-&gt;Exit" menu item allows to close the GUI and kill the JCC agent,
						and optionally shutdown the whole platform.
						The "Help" menu provides access to the Jadex help system and the Jadex homepage.
						Besides this menus plugins may add additional entries that can be used
						for executing plugin-specific actions.
					</p></li><li><p>
						a <span class="emphasis"><em>tool bar</em></span> that offers shortcuts for often used actions.
						The toolbar is thereby devided into two parts. On the left hand side plugin-
						specific actions are displayed. On the right hand side the available plugins
						are shown. The buttons at the right side of the toolbar 
						allow to switch between the perspectives each provided by a plugin 
						(Starter, DF Browser, Conversation Center, Introspector, Tracer, Test Center 
						or Jadexdoc).
						<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/controlcenter/perspectives.png"></span> 
					</p></li><li><p>
						a <span class="emphasis"><em>console</em></span> window nearly at the bottom of the JCC window.
						The console simply shows all output that is written to the System.out (black font
						color) and System.err (red font color) streams. The buttons on the right hand
						side allow to turn off the console and to clear the current output.
					</p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/controlcenter/consolebuttons.png"></span></li><li><p>
						a <span class="emphasis"><em>status bar</em></span> at the bottom of the JCC window. This bar
						fulfills two functionalities. On the left hand side currently relevant information
						is printed out, e.g. when a project was successfully loaded or an agent file
						was scanned for errors. On the right hand side small animated icons appear
						whenever some activity is performed in the background (e.g. scanning files
						for agent testcases).
