Jadex Rules is a general purpose production rule engine, designed
to be easily embedded into Java programs. It supports pluggable
pattern matchers, state representations and rule languages
(Rete-matcher, OAV/Java state and CLIPS-like parser included).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jadex Rules is a spin-off of the Jadex BDI Reasoning Engine
(http://jadex.sourceforge.net). The rule engine has first been implemented as
a basis for the BDI reasoning, but has now been refactored to be general
purpose. As it is therefore of interest to a wider audience, we would like to
host it as a separate project.

The main difference to existing rule engines is the flexible plugging of the
separate rule engine components. Not only does the rule engine support the
use of different pattern matcher algorithms (e.g. Rete or TREAT). It also
supports different state representations like a Java in-memory
representation, RDF representation based on the Jena toolkit, Java EE-based
persistent representation and a J2ME/MIDP compliant mobile representation.
