Jadex is a Belief Desire Intention (BDI) reasoning engine that allows for programming
intelligent software agents in XML and Java. The resoning engine very flexible and can be 
used on-top of different middleware infrastructures such as JADE.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jadex stands for "JADE extension" and represents a Belief Desire Intention (BDI)
extension for the well-known JADE agent platform conceived and developed by
the TILAB. (JADE is an open source project under the LGPL license.
http://sharon.cselt.it/projects/jade/ )

Jadex allows the usage of higher-level agent concepts for implementing
agents. Our project can be seen as an add-on for the JADE platform, because
we directly use the Jade platform features like message sending
and content enconding.

The programming language of jadex is Java and therefore it is OS independent.
