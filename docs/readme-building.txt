This is the complete source distribution of Jadex.
For building the Jadex distribution unpack the sources to a directory of your choice.
For building with Maven just type:
mvn -P jadex-dist package

You can also import the Jadex projects into an IDE like eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
Make sure that your IDE supports Maven builds
(e.g. install the m2eclipse plugin in eclipse).
