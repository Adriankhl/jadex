Jadex V2 can be launched in the following ways:

a) directly via java from the lib directory:
java -jar jadex-platform-standalone-launch-2.0-rc10.jar

b) on Windows machines also via the batch file:
jadex.bat

c) given that you build the project yourself you can directly invoke the platform class
  (classpath needs to be set by your build environment such as eclipse appropriately):
java jadex.base.Starter


In all three cases you can choose to disable the awareness feature,
which is active by default. The awareness feature will find all
Jadex platforms in the network, which also have awareness
activated. The remote platforms can be administered through the JCC,
e.g. to suspend or kill agents. To disable awareness start the platform
with the following option:
-configname "all_kernels (rms, jcc)"

For windows, you can also use the jadex_no_awareness.bat file.
