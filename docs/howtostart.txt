Jadex V2 can be launched in the following ways:

a) directly via java from the lib directory:
java -jar jadex-platform-standalone-launch-2.0-rc4.jar

b) on Windows machines also via the batch file:
jadex.bat

c) given that you build the project yourself you can directly invoke the platform class
  (classpath needs to be set by your build environment such as eclipse appropriately):
java jadex.base.Starter
