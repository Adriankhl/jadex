Agentis Performance
From: "Simplifying the Complexity of Application Development -
Developing and deploying J2EE Solutions with Agentis AdaptivEnterpriseTM Solution Suite"

To reiterate, AdaptivEnterpriseTM Server was designed based on the principles of high performance and
reliability.
Benchmarks provide users with performance reference data to help them estimate deployment time and
cost. The following benchmark data was gathered using a reference application with 103 service
invocations and 8 database calls. (A service invocation is a plan selection and execution action.) Tests
were conducted on single and dual CPU machines (1.4 GHz with 1GB RAM) as well as clusters. The key
parameters monitored were agent creation rate, service invocation rate and response time, database call
rate and response time, and agent concurrency rate. Reliability tests are typically 7-day tests with
measure of down time and memory leakage.
The performance metrics for the fall 2002 release (AdaptivEnterprise 3.5) are listed below:

Agent Creation (at 95% CPU usage)
Rate: 201/sec
Response Time: 50 ms

Service Invocation (at 88% CPU usage)
Rate: 6,950/sec
Response Time: 1.5 ms

Database call (at 66% to 94% CPU usage)
Rate: 590 to 845/sec (depends on the action: insert, select, delete)
Response Time: 10.5 ms to 16.2 ms

Reliability (at 33% CPU usage)
Duration: 7 days
Application runs completed: > 95 million
Down time: none
Memory loss: none

Concurrency (at 90% CPU usage)
400 agents per 500 KB RAM

Clustering (2 CPUs)
Linearity: 80% to 90% (depends on the metric)

JACK performance
From: http://www.agent-software.com/shared/products/faq.html

JACK agents are extremely efficient and light weight. This is demonstrated by having JACK running
on a handheld Psion 5mx.

Benchmarks using JACK have shown the following:

Agents can be created at a rate of over 1,000 per second. An example program which times the creation 
of 100,000 agents reported 72,811ms total time running on a typical midrange PC under Linux. 
Agent destruction delay is insignificant. It is of the order of 10µ-s (ten microseconds) or 
100,000 agents destroyed per second. An example program which times the destruction of 100,000 
agents reported 329ms total time running on an average PC under Linux. 
Agents can send messages to another agent within the same process in times of the order of 10µ-s 
(ten microseconds) or 100,000 messages per second. An example program which times the sending of 
200,000 such messages reported 2662ms total time running on an average PC under Linux.
