Bump Revision:
- set release number in poms and in jadex.bridge.IVersionInfo
- do maven install (for artifacts being locally available)
- clean dependent projects (and iterate from previous step)

Build Distribution:
- remove target directories in jadex and all projects (to avoid eclipse generated stuff in classes like .svn dirs)
- build jadex maven javadoc
- build jadex distribution
- rebuild applications.jccproject.xml
- zip distribution dir
