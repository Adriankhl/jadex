# Jadex Web API
A goal of Jadex Active Components is to integrate easily into Web environments.
This is approached by providing easy REST/Web Service integration as well as a JavaScript API to directly communicate with Jadex services via HTML5 Websockets.

For now, please have a look at the full guide:

This feature is currently in development stage. Documentation will be available soon.
