Addon for Jadex to support 3D environments and visualization.
Jadex 3d is based on the JMonkey Java game engine, which is
also included in this addon.

To install just unzip the 3d-addon to the same location
as the original Jadex distribution. After extracting, the
new jars should be in the same directory (lib) as the original
Jadex jars.

To start with Jadex 3D, just start the platform and have a look
at the examples (in jadex-application-bdi.jar):
jadex/bdi/examples/marsworld/MarsWorld3d.application.xml
jadex/bdi/examples/spaceworld3d/SpaceWorld3d.application.xml
